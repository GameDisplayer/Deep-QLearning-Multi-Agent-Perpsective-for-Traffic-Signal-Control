# Deep Q-Learning Multi Agent Perspective for Traffic Signal Control

This repository is forked from [Andrea Visali's repository](https://github.com/AndreaVidali/Deep-QLearning-Agent-for-Traffic-Signal-Control) which is a framework where a deep Q-Learning Reinforcement Learning agent tries to choose the correct traffic light phase at an intersection to maximize traffic efficiency.
[Here](http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2404/paper07.pdf) is the workshop paper published. 

## Brief description of the scope and objectives of the thesis:

The thesis is aimed at, first, studying the experimental setup and baseline approach of an adaptive traffic signal control system (TLSC) while adding some improvements.

The project goal would, then, be the passage to a multi-agent perspective by implementing two agents independently learning within the traffic environment and analysing their behaviors.

## Goals :

- [ ] Change the state perception of the agent by adding more information (number of cars, average speed, cumulated waiting time, number of queued cars...) and compare with static light traffic.
